BX: performs a branch to a routine whose start address
    is specified in a Lo or Hi register. 
    Bit 0 of the address -- NB: not in the instruction code itself --
    determines the processor state on entry to the routine.
    Bit 0 = 0: causes the processor to enter the ARM state.
    Bit 0 = 1: causes the processor to enter THUMB state.

Some GBA information, gleaned from the mGBA code:

SP_BASE_IRQ
SP_BASE_SUPERVISOR
SP_BASE_SYSTEM

sizeof(*gbacore) = 0x46d0


----

use clump.ret_addr fields to set callbacks in uc
do this, maybe, from eval_fitness, just before calling hatch_chain
(then remove those callbacks afterwards)
this will let us know if all of the ret instructions are actually being
reached. if not, there should be a penalty to fitness.
