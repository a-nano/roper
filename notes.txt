BX: performs a branch to a routine whose start address
    is specified in a Lo or Hi register. 
    Bit 0 of the address -- NB: not in the instruction code itself --
    determines the processor state on entry to the routine.
    Bit 0 = 0: causes the processor to enter the ARM state.
    Bit 0 = 1: causes the processor to enter THUMB state.

Some GBA information, gleaned from the mGBA code:
