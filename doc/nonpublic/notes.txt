ok the interesting thing i thought of for realtime codegen in haskell
 sigfig is to use this
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/harpy-0.6.0.2 â€¦ or a similar
 monadic code generation strategy 21h 21 hours ago sigfig and express
 the probabilistic aspect as like, monad transformers over the code
 monad 21h 21 hours ago and by modifying the monadic value you permute
 your code and can do genetic optimization or w/e sigfig basically
 like how youâ€™d do it in scheme but with a lot more category theory
 21h 21 hours ago

notes for next raytheon meeting:
---------------------------------

* type system
-> re: compiler
-> re: genetics
   -> introns

that's probably enough. play up that "junk dna" stuff, make it cool
like dark matter.
