ABSTRACT:
=-=-=-=-=

ROPER* is a tool for generating ROP-chain payloads -- cannibalizing a
target program's executable memory into shellcode golems ready to do
the attacker's bidding. The technique is uses to do this is called
"genetic programming", which is, essentially, an implementation of
Darwinian natural selection on the level of code. First, on a
"phylogenic" LISP client, ROP-gadgets are extracted from the binary to
form a gene pool. Then a population of random chains is spawned. These
chains are sent over TCP to an array of "ontogenic" server processes
(written in C) that evaluate them, using the Unicorn Emulation Engine
(which Nguyen Anh Quynh launched last year at Black Hat), and sends
back the resulting CPU state. Chains that better approximate the
desired state are rewarded with a higher chance of breeding, either by
sexually recombining with other chains, or by cloning and mutation.
The process continues until the evolution converges on a payload that
does exactly what want -- typically, this means preparing the CPU
context for a particular syscall, with particular parameters.

To cut it short: In this talk, I'll be showing how ROP-chain attacks
work, how to implement your own genetic algorithms, how ROPER in
particular works and how it can be used for fun and profit.

SPEAKER BIO:
=-=-=-=-=-=-

PSEUDO SUE is a gray-hat hacker who's particularly interested in the
use of machine learning in offensive cybersecurity. If anything ever
slips through the Cyberdyne firewall, it might be her fault. In her
hometown of Halifax, NS, she pursues her research in the NIMS security
lab, facilitates cybersecurity workshops for laypeople and activists,
develops vulnerability-scanning scripts, and teaches occasional
college courses on anything from assembly language to biopolitics.
She's also one of the many faces of Laboria Cuboniks. You can find her
on twitter as @0xDEBA5E12.


OUTLINE:
=-=-=-=-
   
1. Primer on Genetic Programming: how to do unnatural things with
   natural selection.
   - natural selection as an abstract algo
   - how to write a genetic 'hello world' in 10 minutes
   - how is this useful knowledge for hackers? what sort of security
     problems are good problems for GP? 
   - a bit on Gunes Kayacik's 2010 work on evolving old school buffer
     overflow/shellcode attacks 
   - (15 minutes)

2. Quick Refresher on Return-Oriented Programming: what to do when you
   can't write to executable memory. 
   - quick and dirty. enough to bring newbies up to speed, but not so
     much as to bore experienced low-level hackers.
   - (4-5 minutes). 

3. Introducing ROPER: how it works, and what you can do with it. 
   - client-side phylogeny (sex and death with ROP-chains): how the
     lisp client manipulates the ROP-chain population
   - ontogenesis as a service: how the C server observes and reports
     the behaviour of the chains sent to it
   - (15 minutes)

4.0 Prayer to the Demo Gods
   - (15 seconds)

4.1 DEMO:
    - Live evolution of a ROP-chain payload for an ARM ELF
      binary.
    - Does it work?
    - (5 minutes)

1) I will submit a completed presentation, a copy of the tool(s)
and/or code(s), and a reference to all of the tool(s), law(s), Web

described in this CFP submission for publication on the conference CD
by 12:00 noon PST, July 08, 2016.

website and Printed Conference Materials by 12:00 noon PST, June 15,
2016.

3) I understand if I fail to submit a completed presentation by July
08, 2016, I may be replaced by an alternate presentation or may
forfeit my honorarium. This decision will be made by DEF CON and I
will be informed in writing of my status.

4) I will include a detailed bibliography as either a separate
document or included within the presentation of all resources cited
and/or used in my presentation.

5) I will complete my presentation within the time allocated to me -
not running over, or excessively under the time allocation.

screens, microphones, wired and/or wireless Internet. I understand
that I am responsible for providing all other necessary equipment,
including laptops and machines (with VGA output), to complete my
presentation.

conference any updated, revised or additional presentation(s) or
materials that were used in my presentation but not included on the
conference CD or conference proceedings.

Terms of Speaking Remuneration

for 3 DEF CON Human badges, received at the start of the conference. I
may also choose to donate my honorarium to charity.

3) I understand that I may receive payment on-site at the conference.
If selecting the $300 payment as my honorarium, I must provide a valid
name and postal mail address so that the payment may be mailed. In
some rare cases, I may be required to complete a W8 (Non-U.S. Citizen)
or W9 (U.S. Citizen) before payment is issued.

4) I understand that I will be paid within 30 days from the end of the
conference, after I have completed my presentation. I understand that
should my talk be determined to be unsuitable (e.g. a vendor or sales
pitch, a talk on the keeping of goats, etc.) after I have presented,
that I will not receive an honorarium.
