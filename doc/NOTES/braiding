i implemented a fitness sharing (niching) algorithm, so that
specimens are rewarded more (in terms of likelihood to survive
and reproduce) if they correctly classify information that's been
difficult for the rest of the population to handle, than
information that's been easy. for the first 1000 or so
iterations, they're adapting to the idiosyncracies of the ARM
architecture -- compensating for underused or overused registers,
etc. but after that the difficulty lines on the right start
braiding, and you see this intricate back and forth taking place,
as skills are selected for and then neglected by the evolutionary
process, and the difficulty of the three classes rotates
constantly, while still spiralling downwards.
