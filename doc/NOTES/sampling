One interesting, and immediately noticeable, effect of evaluating
the specimens on samples of the testing data (20%, say) is that 
avg_gen is no longer a monotonic function of iteration. This can
be seen in the graphs, where avg_gen measures the X-axis. the
other lines twist in epicycles.

it would be worth adding avg_gen/iteration back as a line on the
right panel.
